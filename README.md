Holstein2025 is a benchmark dataset for cow face recognition, collected under real-world conditions at a commercial dairy farm using fixed-position side-view surveillance cameras. This dataset is designed to support research in both cow face detection and identification, helping advance automated, non-contact biometric identification in dairy farming.

Identification
The datasets_v2 folder contains images for training and validation. The file iddataset-split.txt provides details on the training and validation splits. The gallery and query folders contain images for the open-set evaluation.

Detection
Due to file size limitations, the detection dataset will be made available via Google Drive soon.
